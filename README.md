📊 Eniac iPhone 13 Purchase Funnel & A/B Testing Analysis

Welcome to my Data Science project focused on analyzing Eniac’s iPhone 13 purchase funnel and running A/B tests to optimize conversion rates. 
This project demonstrates practical applications of statistics, experimental design, and data-driven decision making.

🚀 Project Overview

Eniac wanted to increase the click-through rate (CTR) of the "SHOP NOW" button on their homepage. Using website traffic data, we:
* Mapped the purchase funnel from site visits to confirmed sales.
* Identified drop-off points where potential buyers leave the funnel.
* Designed A/B tests for different button designs and texts to measure impact on conversions.
* Applied statistical analysis to determine significance of results.

🧠 Key Learnings & Skills

Purchase Funnel Analysis: Understanding user behavior and conversion paths.
A/B Testing: Designing experiments, tracking metrics, and analyzing results.

Statistical Methods:
* Central Limit Theorem & sampling
* Confidence intervals & hypothesis testing
* 1-sample & 2-sample t-tests, chi-square tests
* p-values, Type I & Type II errors

Data-driven Decision Making: Using insights to recommend improvements in UI/UX.

📈 Results

Identified that the “SHOP NOW” button was a major bottleneck in the funnel.
Tested multiple versions of the button: color, text, and combination of both.
Applied statistical analysis to determine which version significantly increased conversions.
